<h2>Discovery: Eliciting Requirements</h2>
<p>Phase One focuses on substantial discovery. By consulting with SFMC stakeholders and analyzing student success workflows, we identify the core "pain points" in financial counseling. This stage translates administrative needs into technical specifications.</p>

    <h3>Scenario</h3>
    <p>The Student Financial Management Center (SFMC) reports that students are missing payment deadlines not because they lack funds, but because they are confused by the "Gap" the difference between their VCU bill and their financial aid package. Advisors are currently overwhelmed by manual "back-of-the-napkin" calculations for hundreds of students. </p></section>

<h3>Scenario</h3>
<p>The Student Financial Management Center (SFMC) reports that students are missing payment deadlines not because they lack funds, but because they are confused by the "Gap" the difference between their VCU bill and their financial aid package.

<h3>Stakeholder Pain Points <br> The End-User's Experience</h3>
<!-- <i>Based on scenario interview responses</i> -->
  
<ul> 
<li><b>The Spreadsheet Fatigue:</b> "I spend 15 minutes of every 30-minute appointment just doing math on a calculator to show a student what they owe. I don't have time to actually advise them on how to pay."</li>
<li><b>Data Lag:</b> "Students see one number in Banner (the student system) and another in their inbox. They don't know which one is current."</li>
<li><b>The Phone Surge:</b> "Our call volume spikes 400% in August because students can't figure out their 'net cost' on their own."</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technical Requirements <br> The IT Developer's Translation</h3>
<!-- <i>Translating the pain points into technical system requirements:</i> -->

<ul>
<li><b>Requirement A: Real-time Logic</b></li>
<p>The system must pull current tuition rates (In-state vs. Out-of-state) and apply them to credit hours automatically.</p>
  
<li><b>Requirement B: Mobile First</b></li>
<p>Since 70% of students access VCU resources via mobile, the interface must be fully responsive.</p>
  
<li><b>Requirement C: Exportability</b></li>
<p>Advisors need a "Generate PDF" button to give students a physical or digital copy of the calculation to take home.</p>
</ul>
