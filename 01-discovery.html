<h2>Discovery: Eliciting Requirements</h2>
<p>Phase One focuses on substantial discovery. By consulting with SFMC stakeholders and analyzing student success workflows, we identify the core "pain points" in financial counseling. This stage translates administrative needs into technical specifications.</p>

    <p>The Student Financial Management Center (SFMC) is facing a retention crisis driven by financial "sticker shock." Students are missing payment deadlines not due to a total lack of funds, but due to calculated confusion—the inability to reconcile their VCU bill with their financial aid package. This manual "information gap" forces advisors into repetitive data entry, leaving zero time for strategic counseling.</p>

      <p><ul> 
        <li><b>Spreadsheet Fatigue:</b></li>
          <p>Staff spend 50% of every appointment performing manual "back-of-the-napkin" math, leaving no time for actual financial coaching or resource connection.</p>
        <li><b>Data Blindspot:</b></li>
          <p>Leadership lacks a real-time view of institutional unmet need, making it impossible to identify which student cohorts are at the highest risk of dropping out before the semester starts.</p>
        <li><b>Phone Surging:</b></li>
          <p>Call volumes spike 400% in August because students cannot calculate their 'net cost' independently, leading to payment delays and anxieties.</p>

    <p><ul>
        <li><b>Requirement A: Self-Service Logic</b></li>
          <p>The system must ingest complex VCU tuition tables (In-state vs. Out-of-state) to provide a mobile-responsive, instant "Out-of-Pocket" figure for students.</p>
        <li><b>Requirement B: Aggregated Risk Mapping</b></li>
          <p>The system must synthesize all student inputs into a high-level Tableau-style visualization, allowing directors to segment "High-Risk" students by gap size and residency.</p>
        <li><b>Requirement C: Intervention Workflow</b></li>
          <p>Advisors need a "The system must transform individual calculations into actionable "cases" where advisors can perform "What-If" scenarios and track outreach status in a unified agent dashboard.</p>
