# VCU-SFMC Student Financial Gap Calculator (MVP)
This repository contains a Pre-Implementation MVP of a Student Financial Gap Calculator, designed for the Student Financial Management Center (SFMC) at VCU.

## Project Overview
This repository serves as a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a Student Financial "Gap" Calculator, developed specifically for the Student Financial Management Center (SFMC) at Virginia Commonwealth University.

In alignment with the Information Technology Developer role, this project demonstrates the full SDLC: from substantial discovery and database design to the implementation of data-driven dashboards. The tool is designed to provide students and advisors with immediate clarity on out-of-pocket costs, directly supporting VCU’s goals for student retention and persistence.

## Key Deliverables
🐏 **<ins>Dynamic Calculator</ins>**: A succinct web application that processes tuition rates, residency status, and financial aid to calculate the "Gap."

🐏 **<ins>Tableau Public Integration</ins>**: A data visualization layer that provides area supervisors with insights into unmet financial needs across demographics.

🐏 **<ins>Synthetic Data Engine</ins>**: A Python-based script that generates dummy data (1,000+ records) to simulate a VCU student information environment while maintaining privacy standards.

🐏 **<ins>Compliance Framework</ins>**: Documentation of a Mock Approval Workflow and an Accessibility Audit to satisfy Commonwealth of Virginia (COV) state agency requirements.

## Implementation & Compliance Standards
As this project is designed for a State Agency environment, it adheres to the following principles:

■ Data Integrity: Rigorous validation logic to ensure calculations are accurate and verifiable against current VCU tuition tables.

■ Accessibility: Built with WCAG 2.1 compliance in mind to ensure the tool is usable by all members of the VCU community.

■ Documentation: Includes a comprehensive User Manual and Technical Specification document, as outlined in the SFMC IT Developer job description.



### Disclaimer
This repository is a work sample for a pre-implementation phase. All student data used within this project is synthetically generated "Dummy Data" and does not reflect actual VCU student records or Restricted Data.
